# Vigilance Decrement Experiment

A low fi lifeguard simulation program meant to study the factors that impact vigilance decrement in lifeguard.
Made using Tkinter

## How to Run 
> Requires Python 3 for csv output
Each file is for one separate condition of the 2 x 2 experiment. Run the desired file according to the desired condition, as expressed in the name.
The Independent variables are: (Frequent or Infrequent) and (stable or Variable)

The instructions for the participants to see are here:

    + [Stable] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DiAOVSAUVhJaKQt-XEq12lQ5Q7yVUWLNWCUbkQkZ1M/edit?usp=sharing)

### Simulation Procedure
The simulation starts with a welcoming page prompting the participants to read the instructions sheet (links above). The participants may then proceed to the training session which lasts 45 seconds, and then to a buffer screen before they start the real experiment. Here they may ask questions to the experimenter should any arise. After that they proceed to the real experiment.

The first 120 seconds are the 'Initial' period, where we have 3 drownings whose times are standard accross all conditions. The final 180 seconds are the 'End' period where we also have 3 drownings with standard times across conditions. In between these we have the 900 second (15 min) long 'Condition' period. During this period there will be either 5 or 41, according to the frequent or infrequent condition. The times are hardcoded and standard within conditions (i.e. requent stable and frequent variable have the same drown times).
